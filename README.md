# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: 
The original purpose of the analysis was to determine key district metrics for the school system.  The defined metrics to be measured included:
    - Top 5 and bottom 5 schools, based on passing rates.
    - Average math score received by students in each grade level.
    - Average reading score received by students in each grade level.
    - School performance based on budget per student.
    - School performance based on the school size.
    - School performance based on the type of school.
    
Upon completion of the analysis, possible academic dishonesty was alleged amongst 9th graders of Thomas High School.  Upon request by the board, 
the following was performed:
    - replaced all 9th grade test scores exclusively for Thomas High School with NaN (Not Available Now).
    - Re-perform the above original analysis with this altered data.
    - Determine the overall impact of the removal of these scores for the school and the district.

## Results: 
For the below results, examples of code and results will be displayed.  The original analysis results will be shown on the left, while the 
altered data set removing the Thomas High 9th graders will be displayed on the right.
