# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: 
The original purpose of the analysis was to determine key district metrics for the school system.  The defined metrics to be measured included:
     - Top 5 and bottom 5 schools, based on passing rates.
     - Average math score received by students in each grade level.
     - Average reading score received by students in each grade level.
     - School performance based on budget per student.
     - School performance based on the school size.
     - School performance based on the type of school.
    
Upon completion of the analysis, possible academic dishonesty was alleged amongst 9th graders of Thomas High School.  Upon request by the board, 
the following was performed:
    - replaced all 9th grade test scores exclusively for Thomas High School with NaN (Not Available Now).
    - Re-perform the above original analysis with this altered data.
    - Determine the overall impact of the removal of these scores for the school and the district.

## Results: 
### How is the district summary affected?

By removing the 9th grade class from the testing results, the district overall saw a minor decrease in the average testing scores in math, with no deviation in the average for reading.  However, the passing percentage of both math and reading showed a slight decline, with an overall passing percentage reduction by 0.1%.
